Some clarification:

* There is no check if the new content is the same as current - Such a request will be present in history
* There is no requirements about request number - so why not use id?
* There is no modification date in history - there is no such requirements

Unfortunately, the project does not contain any test - tests should ensure the safety of the change, but unfortunately
due to lack of time they do not exist.(I'm going to add them in the near future - but then this information will be
deleted)
